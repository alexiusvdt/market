### React flashcards

## Project's Purpose or Goal: 
* users will be able to create flashcards (question/answer pairs) and categorize them (i.e. javascript syntax, design patterns, foreign languages, etc)
* users will be able to take 'quizzes' where they are presented with a stack of cards & record whether or not they got a question right, recieving a 'quiz score' for that round
* users will also be able to do 'free study' mode where they run through all cards in a category

## List the absolute minimum features the project requires to meet this purpose or goal:
* user created cards / pre-seeded data
* successful quiz taking
* database integration
* cards will be in a randomized order

## What tools, frameworks, libraries, APIs, modules and/or other resources (whatever is specific to your track, and your language) will you use to create this MVP? List them all here. Be specific.
* react
* react-bootstrap
* firebase integration

## If you finish developing the minimum viable product (MVP) with time to spare, what will you work on next? Describe these features here: Be specific.
* users will be able to see their most frequently missed cards
* application will track each round of quizzes for aggregate data/leaderboards
* users will be prompted to enter an answer & have it checked
* convert to react native for android/ios use
* users can customize the amount of cards per quiz

## What additional tools, frameworks, libraries, APIs, or other resources will these additional features require?
maybe additional styling libraries

## Is there anything else you'd like your instructor to know?
I really hate going back to c# and wish to spend my time practicing react instead. If this project isn't 'meaty' enough for a capstone I was going to propose a Jira clone & am happy to draw up a proposal for that.

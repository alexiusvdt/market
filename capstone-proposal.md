## Project's Purpose or Goal: 
  * A user will be able to browse a selection of available goods

  * Newtonsoft (i think needed for auth tokens if authentication/ other data serialization)
  * bootstrap or similar/related styling libraries
  * jquery (would be nice for some display features)
  * C#
  * SQL database (mySQL or microsoft sql server)
  

## If you finish developing the minimum viable product (MVP) with time to spare, what will you work on next? Describe these features here: Be specific.
  * account authentication
  * make dinner reservations at their in-house restaurant
  * allow a market employee account to view all orders from users and/or query (with sql implementation) the orders/customers data

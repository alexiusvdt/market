## Project's Purpose or Goal: 
  * A user will be able to browse a selection of available goods
  * Users will be able to add items to a cart & make a purchase
  * Purchase records will be stored in a database

## List the absolute minimum features the project requires to meet this purpose or goal:
  * M/V/C set up for account registration, products, and company information
  * database integration 

## What tools, frameworks, libraries, APIs, modules and/or other resources (whatever is specific to your track, and your language) will you use to create this MVP? List them all here. Be specific.
  * .net 6 
  * efcore
  * LINQ
  * Newtonsoft (i think needed for auth tokens if authentication/ other data serialization)
  * bootstrap or similar/related styling libraries
  * jquery (would be nice for some display features)
  * C#
  * SQL database (mySQL or microsoft SQL, the latter providing advance functionality that I'm not sure integrates with mysql)

## If you finish developing the minimum viable product (MVP) with time to spare, what will you work on next? Describe these features here: Be specific.
  * account authentication
  * allow a market employee account to view all orders from users
  * dockerize the application and/or database 

## What additional tools, frameworks, libraries, APIs, or other resources will these additional features require?
  * docker
  * newtonsoft

Is there anything else you'd like your instructor to know?
